The ResBaz program runs for 3 full days. The first 2 days will focus on learning new skills through hands-on workshops, with a number of different topics/streams on offer. The third day, Festival Day, will provide a chance to relax and get to know people you've been learning with. Festivities will include [lightning talks](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLGw_gfABKlOm3XK1jABr4-ZKPQRJiBDsk3eA5vIchbj9tIw/viewform), tech stalls, and unconference activities.
