# About

The Research Bazaar is a free, 3-day intensive festival and conference where researchers come together to up-skill in next generation digital research tools and scholarship. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun. Throughout 2018 ResBaz events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

**ResBaz Sydney will be hosted by Macquarie University, 3-5 July, 2018**, and is organised and sponsored by University of Technology Sydney, The University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, Western Sydney University, University of New England, and Macquarie University. Here are a few highlights from [ResBaz Sydney 2017](https://storify.com/enigmaticocean/resbaz-sydney-2017).

## Who should attend?

Researchers at all levels from all disciplines. PhD and research Masters students are especially encouraged to apply. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along!
